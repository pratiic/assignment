			<h2>stuff i want to do</h2>

			<p>off the top of my head, i want to become a developer and earn a lot of money. i haven't really decided on what field of development i want to go on. there's just a lot of choose from. its hard to know which one the most promising is. my primary interest was on backend web but it has kind of shifted away along the way but i would like it to come back because from what i know, its a very well-paying field. i kind of like web designing too. front-end isn't all that bad. its fun to play with colors, images and sizes.
